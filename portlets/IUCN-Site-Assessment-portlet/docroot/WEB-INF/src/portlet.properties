## Properties for creating Word document
document.title = 2017 Conservation Outlook Assessment

## Values Tab
values.tab.title = 1. Values
values.table.header = Identifying and describing values
values.table.description = Define the values of this World Heritage site. Each value requires a detailed description and cross-reference to the relevant World Heritage criterion/criteria. Each criterion can encompass a number of values and these should be broken down as relevant. The "Description" column must be systematically referenced\,\ e.g. (SoOUV\,\ 2010). Other important biodiversity values are described separately below.
important.biodiversity.values.table.title = Other Important Biodiversity Values
important.biodiversity.values.table.description = Note: Please do not list "other designations" here (e.g. designation of the site under Ramsar\,\ or as a KBA\,\ IBA\,\ IPA\,\ AZE etc). These are listed automatically for each site on its site assessment page online.

## Threats Tab
threats.tab.title = 2. Threats
current.threats.table.header = Current Threats
current.threats.table.description = Identify threats to the World Heritage site and then cross-reference these to the values they affect. Assess threats against five ratings - Very Low Threat\,\ Low Threat\,\ High Threat\,\ Very High Threat\,\ and Data Deficient (please refer to the Guidelines for a detailed definition of each category). The justification for the assessment is also captured in the threat assessment and must be systematically referenced (e.g. SOC report\,\ 2014).
potential.threats.table.header = Potential Threats
overall.assessment.of.threats.table.header = Overall Assessment of Threats

## Protection and management Tab
protection.management.tab.title = 3. Protection and management
protection.management.table.header = Assessing Protection and Management
protection.management.table.description = Assess the state of protection and management of the World Heritage site below. Determine the effectiveness of protection and management under each topic by selecting one of five ratings: Highly Effective\,\ Mostly Effective\,\ Some Concern\,\ Serious Concern and Data Deficient. These ratings are defined in Table 3.1 of the Guidelines\,\ and questions to help guide the assessment are provided in Table 3.2. The 'Justification for assessment' must be systematically referenced\,\ e.g. (SOC report\,\ 2009).
overall.assessment.protection.table.header = Overall assessment of protection and management

## Assessing values Tab
assessing.tab.title = 4. Assessing values
assessing.current.state.table.header= Assessing the current state and trend of values
assessing.current.state.table.description = Assess the current state and trend of values for the World Heritage site. The current state of values is assessed against five ratings: Good\,\ Low Concern\,\ High Concern\,\ Critical and Data Deficient. The baseline for the assessment should be the condition at the time of inscription\,\ with reference to the best-recorded historical conservation state. Trend is assessed in relation to whether the condition of a value is Improving\,\ Stable\,\ Deteriorating or Data Deficient\,\ and is intended to be a snapshot of recent developments over the last five years. The 'Justification for assessment' must be systematically referenced\,\ e.g. (SOC report\,\ 2009).
assessing.summary.values.table.header = Summary of the Values

## Conservation Outlook Tab
conservation.outlook.tab.title = 5. Conservation Outlook
conservation.outlook.table.header = Assessing Conservation Outlook
conservation.outlook.table.description = Indicate the conservation outlook for the World Heritage site in the table below\,\ based on the assessments of current state and trend of World Heritage values\,\ threats\,\ and protection and management for the site (Steps 1-4). Conservation Outlook is assessed against five ratings: Good\,\ Good with Some Concerns\,\ Significant Concern\,\ Critical\,\ and Data Deficient. The Guidelines provide further details on how each category is defined. Please note\,\ the "Summary of Assessments of Values\,\ Threats\,\ and Protection and Management" table containing the "Justification Of Assessment" and "Assessment" fields has been automatically populated in this table from the previous assessment steps and only the "Assessment of Conservation Outlook" table is new. The assessment summaries and Conservation Outlook should be as detailed and stand-alone as possible.

## Benefits Tab
benefits.tab.title = 6. Benefits
understanding.benefits.table.header = Understanding Benefits
understanding.benefits.table.description = Mark benefits generated by the World Heritage site from the list provided as either "present" or "data deficient" (i.e. benefits that could reasonably be assumed to be present but for which there is little/no information). Benefits that are not marked are assumed to be absent. For each selected benefit\,\ provide a brief summary\,\ along with references wherever possible. Please include information on factors negatively affecting the provision of selected benefits where this is available (indicating the level of impact [Very High\,\ High\,\ Moderate\,\ Low] and the trend [Increasing\,\ Continuing\,\ Decreasing]). Where no information on such factors is available\,\ the fields can be left blank.
summary.of.benefits.table.header = Summary of benefits
summary.of.benefits.table.description = Please provide a brief summary of key benefits generated by the World Heritage site and identified above.

## Projects Tab
projects.tab.title = 7. Projects
active.conservation.projects.table.header = Compilation of active conservation projects
active.conservation.projects.table.description = Indicate known conservation projects in the site. If limited information is available on the organizations and conservation projects within the site\,\ please provide whatever information is easily available\,\ even if incomplete.
potential.site.needs.table.header = Compilation of potential site needs
potential.site.needs.table.description = If information is available on site needs that could be addressed through future project work\,\ please update/record this below\,\ indicating each site need separately.

## References Tab
references.tab.title = 8. References
references.table.description = Record references used in previous steps here. Please note\,\ all information used in assessments needs to be referenced for transparency and so that future assessments can review the previous information base. Information sources must be clearly referenced within the Description column in the case of Step 1\,\ and in the justification for assessment columns in Steps 2\,\ 3 and 4. References should be listed alphabetically and follow the Harvard system\,\ also known as the author date system\,\ which is structured as follows: author(s)\,\ date\,\ title\,\ place of publication\,\ publisher (this is the standard IUCN format). Where possible\,\ URLs for documents available online should be included.
