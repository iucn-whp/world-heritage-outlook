 * The implementation of the whp_sites_flagship_species local service.

 * All custom service methods should be put in this class. Whenever methods are added, rerun ServiceBuilder to copy their definitions into the {@link com.iucn.whp.dbservice.service.whp_sites_flagship_speciesLocalService} interface.
 *
 * <p>
 * This is a local service. Methods of this service will not have security checks based on the propagated JAAS credentials because this service can only be accessed from within the same VM.
